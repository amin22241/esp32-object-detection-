Biomedical Engineering & Edge Impulse with ESP32-CAM

Overview

This project explores the intersection of biomedical engineering, Edge Impulse, and the ESP32-CAM to build innovative, low-cost, and portable diagnostic tools capable of performing real-time analysis at the edge. By combining real-time image processing with edge AI models, the system offers a promising solution for remote healthcare and diagnostics.

Components
	•	Biomedical Engineering
Applies engineering principles to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes — such as designing diagnostic tools, biosensors, and medical imaging systems.
	•	Edge Impulse
A platform for developing and deploying embedded machine learning (TinyML) models on edge devices, allowing for real-time decision-making without cloud dependency.
	•	ESP32-CAM
A low-cost microcontroller with an integrated camera, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth support, ideal for capturing and processing visual data in embedded systems.

Project Goals
	•	Design a compact system for real-time medical image analysis.
	•	Utilize Edge Impulse to train lightweight ML models for anomaly detection.
	•	Enable the ESP32-CAM to collect, preprocess, and classify data entirely on-device.
	•	Support applications such as skin condition detection, respiratory monitoring, or remote triage systems.

How It Works
	1.	Data Collection
The ESP32-CAM captures image data (e.g., skin conditions, eye images, etc.) in real-time.
	2.	Model Training with Edge Impulse
The images are labeled and uploaded to Edge Impulse, where lightweight CNN or custom models are trained for classification or detection tasks.
	3.	Model Deployment
Once trained, the model is optimized and deployed directly to the ESP32-CAM via Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
	4.	On-Device Inference
The ESP32-CAM runs the model locally, detecting patterns or anomalies in real time — no internet required.
	5.	Data Transmission (Optional)
Results can be sent over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to a mobile device or server for display or further action.

Applications
	•	Early skin cancer detection
	•	Monitoring wound healing
	•	Detecting eye infections
	•	Respiratory rate classification (via motion detection)
	•	Smart pill dispensers with face verification

Tools & Libraries
	•	Edge Impulse Studio
	•	Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
	•	ESP32-CAM libraries (CameraWebServer, esp32-camera)
	•	TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (via Edge Impulse)

Future Work
	•	Expand to multi-modal sensing (e.g., audio + image for cough + skin condition).
	•	Integrate low-power modes for wearable applications.
	•	Add remote data logging and dashboards for healthcare providers.
